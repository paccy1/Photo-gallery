## Project Description
This project contains three main components:
1. A responsive gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Two JavaScript coding challenges:
   - Determining if a contiguous subarray sums up to a given target.
   - Transforming a string based on specific conditions.

## Responsive Gallery Challenge
This section of the project is a responsive image gallery that adjusts to different screen sizes. The gallery features interactive elements such as hover effects and "Know more" links.

### Features
- Responsive design using CSS flexbox and media queries.
- Custom fonts using @font-face.
- Hover effects for images and overlays.
- JavaScript to handle interactivity.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Contiguous Subarray Sum
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return `true` if such a subarray exists, otherwise return `false`.
## Challenge 2: String Transformation

This challenge involves transforming a given input string based on its length. The transformation rules are as follows:

1. If the length of the input string is divisible by 3, the string is reversed.
2. If the length of the input string is divisible by 5, each character in the string is converted to its ASCII code, and the codes are joined with spaces.
